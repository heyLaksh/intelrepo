## The algorithm for implementing the state diagram as both a Moore and Mealy machine:

### Algorithm for Moore Machine implementation:

1. Initialize the current state as Room0.
2. Receive the binary travel plan sequence.
3. For each binary value in the sequence, do the following:
   a. Check the current state.
   b. If the current state is Room0:
      - If the binary value is 0, stay at Room0.
      - If the binary value is 1, go to Room1.
   c. If the current state is Room1:
      - If the binary value is 0, go to Room2.
      - If the binary value is 1, go to Room4.
   d. Repeat the above steps for each state transition defined in the state diagram.
4. After processing the entire travel plan sequence, output the final current location.

### Algorithm for Mealy Machine implementation:

1. Initialize the current state as Room0.
2. Receive the binary travel plan sequence.
3. For each binary value in the sequence, do the following:
   a. Check the current state.
   b. If the current state is Room0:
      - If the binary value is 0, stay at Room0 and output Room0 as the current location.
      - If the binary value is 1, go to Room1 and output Room1 as the current location.
   c. If the current state is Room1:
      - If the binary value is 0, go to Room2 and output Room2 as the current location.
      - If the binary value is 1, go to Room4 and output Room4 as the current location.
   d. Repeat the above steps for each state transition defined in the state diagram.
4. After processing the entire travel plan sequence, output the final current location.

Both algorithms follow the state transitions defined in the state diagram and produce the current location as the output. The main difference between Moore and Mealy machines lies in when the output is generated: in Moore machines, the output depends only on the current state, while in Mealy machines, the output can also depend on the inputs.
